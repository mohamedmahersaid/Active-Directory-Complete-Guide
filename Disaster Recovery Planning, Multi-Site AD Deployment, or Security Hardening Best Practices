20️⃣ Security Hardening Best Practices
________________________________________
🔐 Domain Controller Security
•	Ensure DCs are physically and logically secure.
•	Disable unnecessary services on DCs.
•	Apply least privilege model to admins.
•	Enforce secure channel traffic (LDAP signing, SMB signing).

📜 Group Policies
•	Enforce strong password and lockout policies.
•	Configure audit policies to log key activities.
•	Disable Guest account and remove unused default accounts.

🚫 Block Lateral Movement
•	Deploy tiered administration (Tier 0/1/2 model).
•	Use separate privileged accounts.
•	Limit interactive logon rights on DCs.

🔒 Hardening LDAP and RDP
•	Require LDAPS or secure RDP (via certificate).
•	Block untrusted networks from accessing DCs directly.

🌍 21️⃣ Multi-Site AD Deployment
________________________________________

🗺️ Design Overview
•	Site A (Primary): 172.16.1.0/24
•	Site B (DR): 172.16.2.0/24
•	Each site has at least 1 DC.
•	Sites are linked with AD Site Links (default cost 100).
🔧 Configure AD Sites and Services
1.	Open Active Directory Sites and Services.
2.	Create two new Sites: HQ-Site, DR-Site.
3.	Associate each subnet to the correct site:
o	172.16.1.0/24 → HQ-Site
o	172.16.2.0/24 → DR-Site
4.	Move Domain Controllers to the appropriate site.
5.	Configure replication schedule and Site Link Bridge if needed.

🧠 Tip: Keep FSMO roles centralized unless intentional redundancy is needed.

💥 22️⃣ Disaster Recovery Planning
________________________________________

🧰 Backup Essentials
•	Use Windows Server Backup, Veeam, or similar to back up:
o	System State
o	Active Directory (NTDS.DIT, SYSVOL)
o	DNS Zones (if integrated)

🔁 Recovery Process
1.	Restore System State from backup.
2.	Perform Authoritative Restore if needed:
ntdsutil
activate instance ntds
authoritative restore
3.	Restore DNS or other dependencies as needed.

📑 DR Runbook Suggestions
•	Regular backup validation/testing.
•	Isolate DR replication traffic.
•	Document failover plan:
o	Promote DR DC
o	Seize FSMO if needed
o	Adjust DNS priorities (SRV records, client configs)

⛑️ Tools
•	wbadmin for backup/restore
•	ntdsutil for authoritative restore
•	repadmin & dcdiag for post-recovery verification
